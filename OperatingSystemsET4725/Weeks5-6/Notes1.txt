Linux scheduler - CFC 

Pre-Emptive  - clock based(each program gets time allocated on the CPU)

Non-Preemptive - not clock based(task can run to completion) 

Scheduling note - different power modes, different priorities(from kernal space and user space)[Handled by the OS]

ATT - Average Turn-around Time

Priority Based Scheduling - After a certain number of ticks on the CPU, if a process is not completed, the OS will raise the priority level of that process. 

LINUX USER SPACE
20 priority levels
0 -> 19
0 being the highest, 19 being the lowest

LINUX KERNAL SPACE
20 priority levels
-20 -> -1
-20 being the top priority, -1 being the lowest
