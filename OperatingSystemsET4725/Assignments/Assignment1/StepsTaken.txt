- Went to virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
- Downloaded VirtualBox 6.0.2 for Ubuntu 18.04 /18.10/ Deb10
- on the Terminal: cd ~/Downloads/
- dpkg -i virtualbox-6.0_6.0.2-128262_Ubuntu_bionic_amd64.deb
- sudo !! to run this command as root
- errors installing virtualbox (needed libqt5opengl5 to install) OpenGL
- installed OpenGL5
- used dpkg to install virtualbox
- Went to lubuntu.me/downloads
- Downloaded 18.04 LTS 64bit version
- Created a profile for the virtual machine
- Initial settings 
			general >> Basic: 
				Name: lubuntu18.04.1LTS
				Type: Linux
				Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
			System >> Acceleration:
				VTx/AMD-V, Nested Paging, KVM Paravirtualization
- Ran into an error on bootup: This kernal requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU.
  - Turned on Acceleration settings but not supported.
  - checked my systems processor architecture using Neofetch and uname -m
  - it was x86-64, so I downloaded the 32bit version of lubuntu to check if that would work.
  - got a new error about PAE in the bios.
  - booted into the bios and found Virtualization turned off. 
  - switch back to the 64bit lubuntu, worked. 
- Installed the lubuntu OS
- created a primary partition mounted at / root, and a swp partition of 2GB
- Ran into a problem with mounting a shared folder between the two systems
  - Solving the issue with guest addons
  - Insert guest add-ons CD image
  - There were some issues also with installing the GAs, so I needed to activate the root account
	- Activating the root account by giving it a password with the passwd command
		passwd root
  - When I got access to running the GAs scripts I ran the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run script with 
    ./VBoxAdditions.run
- Ran into another error when the chown command and the usermod commands would not give access to the sf_VirtualBoxShare mount point, the permissions were set as user:root and group:svboxsf.
  - The way around this was to add my user account the the svboxsf group with the adduser command
  - sudo adduser grahamclaffey vboxsf
- The list of commands that I used:
  - ps -ef | grep -i "VBox" and ps -ej | grep -i "VBox", ls -l, whoami, uname -m, manpages, dpkg, apt, 
   

- Completed all the tasks.
