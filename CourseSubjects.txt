Embedded Systems Engineering (Specialist Diploma)

My current list of subjects and the topics they cover.

ET4725 Operating Systems
- Processes - general concepts, states, queues, ps, signals etc.
- Scheduling - basic concepts round-robin etc.
- The bash shell, basic commands including grep.
- Shell: sed, awk, variables etc.
- Shell: arithmetic (quick treatment) and programming constructs.. for, while, if, .. etc.
- C concurrent processes, IPC pipes.
- Virutalisation: more concept and examples including storage.
- More on bash shell: date, arrays, functions, dd etc.
- File systems: basic disk drive technology and performance.
- More on UNIX files, file operations, protection etc.
- File systems: the FAT file system and the basic i-node file system.
- C programming: using the compiler, command line, argc and argv etc.
- POSIX file system calls.
- Writing a bash command from scratch.
- Concept of threads.
- Overview of Windows as a threaded OS.
- Wider applications of Linux OS: embedded systems, automotive, IoT etc.



ED5502 Digital Systems 4
- Microprocessor hardware systems.
- DRAMs.
- Memory interfaces, I/O interfacing - serial and parallel interfaces.
- Interrupts, Bus standards, Bus cycle timing.
- Typical peripheral interfaces including ADC and DAC converters.
- Practical: Use of development environment (ARM STM32 / Arduino) to code, simulate, test and debug assembly / C code.



EE6422 Real Time System Design
- Scheduling Algorithms: Clock-driven, Earliest deadline first, Rate monotonic, Resource allocation.
- Programming language features for real-time support: for concurrency, synchronisation, hard-scheduling etc.
- Study of features of languages such as C++, Ada, Modula-2, Chill etc.
- Operating System Features: to define a real-time operating system, Emphasis is on embedded systems.
- Design Approaches: Time continuous data flow, event flow and control transformation, State transtion diagram representation, Design approaches eg. DARTS.
- Design and MOdeling using Petri Nets: Modeling of concurrent systems states and events using Petri-nets which include temporal properties in the model.
- Design and Analysis using RTL: Introduction to real-time logic, RTL, Application of RTL, Real-time temporal logic. State Machines and Real-time temporal logic.
- Real-Time Program Verification: Testing methods, Risk calculation, Static analysis, Simulation as a verification tool.




ED5031 Software Engineering
- Software Engineering and Ethical Responsibilities.
- Software Processes for software production.
- Requirements Engineering and Systems Models.
- Project Management.
- Object-Oriented design with the UML - Unified Modeling Launguage.
- Design with reuse.
- Individual/Team Project/Case Study to complete a Software design/management document.



IE2011 Industry-based project (Individual or Team)
- Students to identify a suitable project (expectation: a review of any embedded system related topic/technique/design)
- Outcome: A conference-style paper (e.g. 6-8 IEEE format pages) + presentation at a mock conference held for all students (attendance compulsory)
